# min-max-mean-sd-norm-using-array

1. Write a C program which should create 6 different arrays (using different math functions) of size N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6 obtained from user input. (Note, Ni (i = 1, 2,3,4,5, 6) should be different values)
2. This program should find min, max, mean, SD values and pth norm (where p value should be entered by user) of all the arrays.
3. Moreover, print which array has minimum value of pth norm.
4. Next, print values of each array which lies in the interval [mean-sd, mean+sd];
